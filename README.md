## Installation
To Install this project you will need to clone the repo from GitHub and then install NPM via your command line. Once you have everything ready to go, CD into the repo and in the command line enter 'node index.js' (You will need to have the software for Node installed also - see Node.JS documentation [https://nodejs.org/en] for install instructions)

## Usage
Once you have the needed installs complete, when you enter Node Index.js in your command line questions following the ones seen here will generate. Answer each question as it relates to your project and a README will be generated for you based on the info you provide. This is a nice and easy way to get your README built out and formatted for use. You can always add more to the README if you'd like once it is generated also! I will be adding this video to this readme after it has been generated.

A video of using this application once you have everything installed can be viewed here:
